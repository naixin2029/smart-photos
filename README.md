## SOFT3888 Capstone Project ##
# Smart Photos #

With so many photos being shared online and the ease of which they can be edited, our ability to verify the authenticity of an image has been reduced. There is a new need for an application that allows verifiable information to be encoded alongside an image and be shared with those who need to see it. This has applications in many enterprise environments and contractor-contractee relationships. Our goal is to develop a mobile app that allows contractors and contracteeâ€™s to send photos to each other and verify them via any metadata associated with those photos.
